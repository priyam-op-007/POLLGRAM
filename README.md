## Project Name: - POLLGRAM 
**Tagline** - We have created a website accessible by anyone and anywhere; where they can create polls for their own purposes such as surveys, fun, opinion, governmental schemes, etc. This platform is secured and authentic because we have used secured backend platform for it and also we have linked it with Aadhar system.

**The problem it solves** - POLLGRAM is such a place where you can get systematically arranged statistics for the poll you have created and to increase its genuineness people are needed to link their Aadhar card also called KYC to cast their vote. It solves many bigger problems such as it amplifies the interaction between government and people, as government can now take opinions from people on their projects and schemes, also by using it we can get a look around conditions during elections. Content creators no matter from which field they are if they run out of ideas they can cast their poll here to know the mind of their audience and what they are willing to watch. Also, you can gather your friends and family and can create enjoyable polls as we have different varieties of polls that are easy to understand.

**Challenges we ran into** - Our primary problem was the security of this website which we have solved using the safest backend frameworks, another one was how we can take care of casting duplicate votes or fake votes so we introduced the Aadhar system so no one can misuse the platform. The last problem was arranging interesting and creative polls, also arranging their data in a simple way so that users will understand it with ease. 

**Technology we used** - Django framework platform, HTML and CSS

Our Motto
> To provide simple and better platform for people with goals.
